description: "The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe (now more commonly rendered\
  \ as \"The Further adventures of Robinson Crusoe\") is a novel by Daniel Defoe,\
  \ first published in 1719. Just as in its significantly more popular predecessor,\
  \ Robinson Crusoe (1719), the first edition credits the work's fictional protagonist\
  \ Robinson Crusoe as its author. It was published under the considerably longer\
  \ original title: The Farther Adventures of Robinson Crusoe; Being the Second and\
  \ Last Part of His Life, And of the Strange Surprising Accounts of his Travels Round\
  \ three Parts of the Globe. Although intended to be the last Crusoe tale, the novel\
  \ is followed by a third and final novel involving the character by Defoe entitled\
  \ Serious Reflections of Robinson Crusoe (1720).\nThe story is speculated to be\
  \ partially based on Moscow embassy secretary Adam Brand's journal detailing the\
  \ embassy's journey from Moscow to Peking from 1693 to 1695.\n\n\n From Wikipedia\
